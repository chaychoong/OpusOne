# Opus One

Opus One is a monospaced typeface made for displaying code. Read more about it [here](https://blog.chay.dev/i-made-a-font).

This is an early release, and there are some **limitations**:
- only 95 glyphs in the character sets, just the ones used by most programming languages
- only regular and bold weights, so variable font interpolation only works between 400 and 700
- no ligatures
- no nerd fonts
